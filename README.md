# ICFP Contest 2021 "Rotten Lambdas" Entry

We wrote two interactive tools to manipulate figures.

We also wrote some variations of automated solvers. Some of these
worked well on smaller problems, but we did not manage to come up
with a way to solve the "ball of yarn" probllems like 105 und 106.

We also combined automatic and manual solving by hand-optimizing
some of the solutions of out autoamtic solvers.
